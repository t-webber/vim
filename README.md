A buffer that listens for vim keymaps.

## Development status

The buffer only supports a single line for now.

Refer to [keys.rs](tests/keys.rs) to see the list of supported keymaps.

## CLI demo

You can play with an example of this library in the terminal with

```sh
cargo run --example cli
```

## Usage

```rust
use vim_buffer::{Buffer, Mode};
use vim_buffer::crossterm::event::{Event, KeyEvent, KeyCode};

let mut buffer = Buffer::default();
assert_eq!(buffer.as_mode(), Mode::Normal);

// Update it with crossterm events
buffer.update(&Event::Key(KeyEvent::from(KeyCode::Char('i'))));
for ch in "hello".chars() {
    buffer.update(&Event::Key(KeyEvent::from(KeyCode::Char(ch))));
}
assert_eq!(buffer.as_content(), "hello");

// Update with Vim string
buffer.update_from_string("<Esc>0rHA, World!");
assert_eq!(buffer.as_content(), "Hello, World!");
```

## Performance

The buffer is internally represented as a `String` and thus, editions can be costly. `String` was chosen because most of use cases are: 1) display the buffer, 2) update the buffer, 3) redisplay the buffer, and this over and over again. There are two choices: optimise the data structure for editions (that are only a subset of updates, e.g. you can move the cursor around, play with history, etc.) or optimise it for display (which is done at every update. That is why `String` was chosen.
